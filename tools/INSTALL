Installation Instructions
*************************

As of version 0.6, PICOS Tools uses CMake. CMake is an open source build tool that may be downloaded at http://www.cmake.org. Also, check your operating system's package installer for availability of prebuild binaries.

It is suggested that building take place in a subdirectory. This is not required, but it is convenient. Either way, the first step is to change to the desired build directory. Then run
	cmake <path to source files>

Next, run make and optionally make install. To install into a specific directory, add the cmake flag
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>
where <DIR> is the path into which the software should be installed.
